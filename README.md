# Detection of diabetic retinopathy based on fundus images using convolutional neural networks

**Topic**: Detection of diabetic retinopathy based on fundus images using convolutional neural networks
**Subject**: Artificial Inteligence

In this project, I utilized convolutional neural networks (CNN) and supervised learning techniques to tackle the task of detecting diabetic retinopathy from fundus images.
I applied a variety of preprocessing techniques to enhance image quality, ensuring clarity and consistency throughout the dataset.
Addressing the challenge of imbalanced datasets common in medical contexts, i implemented strategies to effectively manage class imbalance and enable learning from minority classes.
Despite facing limitations in computational resources, I optimized my approach to operate efficiently within these constraints more specifically optimizing the parameters.
Crafting a customized CNN architecture tailored to the dataset and task, i leveraged its capability to extract intricate image features relevant to diabetic retinopathy detection. 
Upon evaluation, the model yielded promising results, underscoring the effectiveness of my approach. For further insight into my project open the documentation file
