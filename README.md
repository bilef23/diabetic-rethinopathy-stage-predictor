### **Topic**: Detection of diabetic retinopathy based on fundus images using convolutional neural networks    
**Subject**: _Artificial Inteligence_

In this project, I utilized convolutional neural networks (CNN) and supervised learning techniques to tackle the task of detecting diabetic retinopathy from fundus images.
Variety of preprocessing techniques were applied in order to enhance image quality, ensuring clarity and consistency throughout the dataset.
In response to the common challenge of imbalanced datasets in medical tasks, I developed and applied effective strategies to address class imbalance.enabling learning from minority classes.
Despite facing limitations in computational resources, I optimized my approach to operate efficiently within these constraints more specifically optimizing the parameters.
Crafting a customized CNN architecture tailored to the dataset and task, i leveraged its capability to extract intricate image features relevant to diabetic retinopathy detection. 
Upon evaluation, the model yielded promising results, underscoring the effectiveness of my approach. For further insight into my project open the documentation file
